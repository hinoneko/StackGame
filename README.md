## Stack Game

Stack Game is a single-player project where your goal is to stack all the bricks perfectly. The game has a simple design that contains colored bricks and a plain background color. The purpose of the project is to have fun with friends.

Stack Game is built using a basic JavaScript coding structure to create a simple operating program that can be easily understood by beginners.

### How to Play

1. The game starts with one fixed block.
2. The next blocks start to move horizontally across the screen.
3. Press the spacebar to stop the moving block and place it on the previous one.
4. The more precisely you stop the block above the previous one, the larger its area. The non-matching part of the block is cut off.
5. Subsequent blocks become smaller if they are not stacked accurately.
6. With each subsequent block, the speed increases.
7. The game ends when the stacking moment is missed.
